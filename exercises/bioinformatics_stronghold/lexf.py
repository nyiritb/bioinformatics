Problem
Assume that an alphabet A has a predetermined order; that is, we write the alphabet as a permutation A=(a1,a2,…,ak), where a1<a2<⋯<ak. For instance, the English alphabet is organized as (A,B,…,Z).

Given two strings s and t having the same length n, we say that s precedes t in the lexicographic order (and write s<Lext) if the first symbol s[j] that doesn't match t[j] satisfies sj<tj in A.

Given: A collection of at most 10 symbols defining an ordered alphabet, and a positive integer n (n≤10).

Return: All strings of length n that can be formed from the alphabet, ordered lexicographically (use the standard order of symbols in the English alphabet).
